## Project Goal

To provide users with a mobile-first companion to the game Animal Crossing New
Horizons. The assumption is that most players aren't likely to have a computer
with them,. or would prefer not to. The convenience of a mobile phone os much
better when playing games. The issue is that mosh gaming websites with the key
information that they need are not easy to navigate on a mobile and represent
the data badly. This project aims to clear this up for players by providing a
simple and clean interface with all of the information they need at a glance.

## Project Status

This project is currently abandoned. I have no plans to continue working on it
as I have lost interest in the game. I may come back to it in the future if I
start playing again but it's unlikely.

When I first started working on this, there weren't any other projects like it
available. Since then, many have popped up and are much better than this one.
While I think that this is the best for a quick reference, especially on mobile,
it's not worth continuing to work on it.
