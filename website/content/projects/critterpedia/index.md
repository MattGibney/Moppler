## Project Goal

To provide users with a mobile-first companion to the game Animal Crossing New
Horizons. The assumption is that most players aren't likely to have a computer
with them,. or would prefer not to. The convenience of a mobile phone os much
better when playing games. The issue is that mosh gaming websites with the key
information that they need are not easy to navigate on a mobile and represent
the data badly. This project aims to clear this up for players by providing a
simple and clean interface with all of the information they need at a glance.
