# MUD (Untitled Game)

I'm not old enough to have played any MUDs when they were popular but they are
something i've been interested in for many years. I'm personally less interested
in actually playing them. Im mostly interested in the idea of making them. As
the user interface is all text it's pretty liberating. I'm free to spend all of
my time working on game mechanics.
