Hi there, i'm Moppler 👋🏻

By day, i'm a proud dad, programmer and mechanical keyboard enthusiast. By night,
I'm also those things, but also tired.

I like to dabble in projects, most of the time I don't get any where near to
completing them. Most of my Github Repos are provate because the sheer number of
abandoned projects is staggerring.

The Moppler handle is relatively new, I created it as my old one was too closely
linked to my real identity and as i've gotten older, I have found that I prefer
the anonymity.

If I don't completely forget, I plan to use the space to document my thoughts
as well as some of the odd projects that I work on.


## Get in touch

Wether you are interested in joining me on one of my projects or think i'd be
interested in one of yours. Please get in touch, i'd love to hear from you.
