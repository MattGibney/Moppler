Hi there, I'm Moppler 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer and I love to build things. I'm currently working on
some commercial mobile apps but when I have the free time, I like to work on
open source projects.

I primarily work with Typescript, react and react-native. I'm currently learning
Swift and really getting stuck into the Apple ecosystem. I've got plenty of
experience with Perl too, but I'm not sure if that's something to brag about.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually playing video games, normally Factorio on the
laptop or Forza on the Xbox. I'm also a massive fan of Lego and have a huge
collection of sets, mostly vehicles.

## Get in touch

Interested in joining me on one of my projects or think i’d be interested in one
of yours? Please get in touch, i’d love to hear from you.
