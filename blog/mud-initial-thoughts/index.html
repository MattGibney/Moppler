  <h3 id="a-little-history">A little history</h3>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time i&rsquo;ve had a go at building MUDs. I&rsquo;ve tried a couple of
different times over the years. I&rsquo;ve tried building from scratch and i&rsquo;ve tried
using frameworks. All of them have worked with limited success but none of them
have been totally successful. In hindsight, I think i&rsquo;ve struggled to get
excited about them because they have all felt awkward to program. A combination
of using telnet and trying to emulate things i&rsquo;ve seen in existing populat MUDs
have muddied my views of things. With this latest attempt I want to try and fix
my issues.</p>
<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>
<p>In my opinion, telnet has served its purpose and is not worth pursuing anymore;
Time to move on. After a lot of thought I have settled on shipping a client.
I&rsquo;d be interested in making use of ssh for this <a href="https://medium.com/@shazow/ssh-how-does-it-even-9e43586e4ffc">theres a great blog post about it.</a></p>
<p>In order to keep things simple and allow me to iterate quickly, the plan is to
start with a CLI written in Node and shipped via NPM. It&rsquo;s free, easy and I
know exactly how to do it. Making use of the terminal provides me with a strict
limitation on aesthetics, keeping my focus on mechanics. The best part however,
is that my implementation makes it pretty easy to add different, more
sophisticated, clients in the future.</p>
