      <description>A little history This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time i&amp;rsquo;ve had a go at building MUDs. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a couple of different times over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried building from scratch and i&amp;rsquo;ve tried using frameworks. All of them have worked with limited success but none of them have been totally successful. In hindsight, I think i&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to get excited about them because they have all felt awkward to program. A combination of using telnet and trying to emulate things i&amp;rsquo;ve seen in existing populat MUDs have muddied my views of things.</description>
