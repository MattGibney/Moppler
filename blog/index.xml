      <description>Server | Client
 After quite a lot of experimenting as well as playing around with different methods of communication between the client and the server, I finally settled on something that seems to work.
Server asks: What would you like to do? and provides choices.
{ type: &amp;#39;requestInstruction&amp;#39;, data: { availableInstructions: [ { name: &amp;#39;Look&amp;#39;, instruction: &amp;#39;look&amp;#39; }, { name: &amp;#39;Move&amp;#39;, instruction: &amp;#39;move&amp;#39;, arguments: [ { type: &amp;#39;select&amp;#39;, name: &amp;#39;direction&amp;#39;, playerPrompt: &amp;#34;Which Direction?</description>

      <description>A little history This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time i&amp;rsquo;ve had a go at building MUDs. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a couple of different times over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried building from scratch and i&amp;rsquo;ve tried using frameworks. All of them have worked with limited success but none of them have been totally successful. In hindsight, I think i&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to get excited about them because they have all felt awkward to program. A combination of using telnet and trying to emulate things i&amp;rsquo;ve seen in existing populat MUDs have muddied my views of things.</description>
